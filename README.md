# Aadhaar Udhaar

# What is Aadhaar?
Aadhaar is a 12-digit unique identification number issued by the Indian government to every individual resident of India.
Aadhaar is the world's largest biometric ID system, with over 1.123 billion enrolled members as of 28 February 2017. Hence Aadhaar is called "Aam Aadmi Ka Adhikaar".

# About our Application
We have decided to make an android application which integrates Aadhaar Card authentication. The application is a borrow - lend application where any user who borrows money from another user must provide an Aadhaar as an identity. The QR code on the Aadhaar Card is scanned and all the relevant information about the user like his name, address, UID etc. is stored on along with the amount he has borrowed.

# Problem of Common man solved!
This application is useful for people who run businesses like canteens, general stores and other such vendors who face problems when customers buy stuff and decide to pay later. In such cases, they maintain a record of customers on paper. This is susceptible to a lot of fraudulent cases like fake identiy of customers(someone can buy item faking his identity). Our application removes this vulnerability by authenticating the customers through Aadhaar Card and fetching relevant information about the customer - hence removing the hassle of maintaining a physical register for a "COMMON MAN" .
